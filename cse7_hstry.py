THE STORY BEGINS HERE:
Tomorrow, I will be really in trouble. At the time I see a very {adj1} {animal} {v1} down the hallway,
 everything will be a snowball of caos. It is inevitable that I will yell
"{xcl}!". Although all I will think to do {v2} over and over, miraculously, a {adj2} {adj3} wizard wearing 
a {cloth} will be there,and he will stop the {animal}. However,the {adj2} wizard will try to {v3}
right in front of my family. He will teach me some magic spells such as the {n}. Just after that, the
{org} will be there to stop the wizard, but he will say that I am the wizard which is partially true 
because of  my skills in {skill}. The {adj4} {org} will try to {v4} me, but I am the best in {skill} 
,so I will stop them temporarly. The {org} is very dangerous! I have no other option that try to change the future 
sending me this code to the past. If you are me, please avoid a {animal}; it will be the start of the end and say "I am {n2}" to the wizard,
he will understand.""")
